# Advent of Code 2018

Three simple rules for this year:
* No for and while cycles or forEach methods allowed.
* Every method starts with a return statement (with exception of main, reducer and generate methods and CheckedWrapper class).
* No method has more than two indents while staying readable (keep the lines short and easy to read).
